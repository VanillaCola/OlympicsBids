<p>The summer Olympic Game or the Game of the Olympiad is the largest international multi-sport event. The first summer Olympic Game was held in 1896 at Athens, Greece then hosted by a different city every four years. Hosting an Olympic Game oftentimes requires the host city to build new stadiums, expand mass transit system and renovate the public facilities. All these will bring challenges as well as tremendous development opportunities to the host city, such as creating new jobs, 
receiving financial investments and attracting global attentions. Due to the benefits of hosting an Olympic Games, the major cities that are interested in hosting the game need to bid for it and rival for the hosting right. For example, 12 major cities around the world bid for the hosting right of 1936 Olympic Game and eventually Berlin, Germany was selected as the host city.</p> 
<p>People tend to only pay attention to the host city and the Game itself. For example, everyone knows that Rio hosted the 2016 summer Olympic Game; but probably only few people know that Chicago was also one of the candidate cities that bid for this game. Certainly this bidding process is an essential component of Olympic Games but often time overlooked by many people. </p>
<p>We therefore want to present the data for Olympic Game bid using interactive visualization techniques. This project can help people to have a more comprehensive understanding of the Olympic Game.</p>
<p>The source webpages contain tables that tabulate the candidate city information for each game. However, the table is not interactive and lacks appropriate aggregate information. We will extract the data from the source
webpages and visualize it using interactive techniques, including map and stack bar chart. For each summer Olympic Game, our design will interactively display the candidate city names, exhibit their geographic locations on the map, how many times they participated in the bids and how many times they won the hosting right, as well as some other well-designed aggregate information. We will also color the cities based on their continental location and our implementation might contain the option to zoom in to show each individual continent. </p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>
The visualizations used in our project gives the audiences a deep understanding of the History bids of the Olympic Games without directly looking into the tablur data. The visual encodings used in the visualization significantly demonstrates the point we proposed. It is easy to realize the popular candidate city (the city hosted multiple times) in the history of the Olympic Games. This reflects the potentially commerical opportunities and help people to take a bid of what is the city will win the hosting right for the next Summer Olympic Game.
