<p>The summer Olympic Game or the Game of the Olympiad is the largest international multi-sport event. The first summer Olympic Game was held in 1896 at Athens, Greece then hosted by a different city every four years. Hosting an Olympic Game oftentimes requires the host city to build new stadiums, expand mass transit system and renovate the public facilities. All these will bring challenges as well as tremendous development opportunities to the host city, such as creating new jobs, 
receiving financial investments and attracting global attentions. Due to the benefits of hosting an Olympic Games, the major cities that are interested in hosting the game need to bid for it and rival for the hosting right. For example, 12 major cities around the world bid for the hosting right of 1936 Olympic Game and eventually Berlin, Germany was selected as the host city.</p> 
<p>People tend to only pay attention to the host city and the Game itself. For example, everyone knows that Rio hosted the 2016 summer Olympic Game; but probably only few people know that Chicago was also one of the candidate cities that bid for this game. Certainly this bidding process is an essential component of Olympic Games but often time overlooked by many people. </p>
<p>We therefore want to present the data for Olympic Game bid using interactive visualization techniques. This project can help people to have a more comprehensive understanding of the Olympic Game.</p>
<p>The source webpages contain tables that tabulate the candidate city information for each game. However, the table is not interactive and lacks appropriate aggregate information. We will extract the data from the source
webpages and visualize it using interactive techniques, including map and stack bar chart. For each summer Olympic Game, our design will interactively display the candidate city names, exhibit their geographic locations on the map, how many times they participated in the bids and how many times they won the hosting right, as well as some other well-designed aggregate information. We will also color the cities based on their continental location and our implementation will also contain the option to zoom in to show each individual country and continent. </p>

The visualizations used in our project provides the audiences a deep understanding of the history of the bids of Olympic game in an interactive manner, without the need of looking into the tabular data. The visual encodings used in our visual implementation were carefully chosen and effective in demonstrating the points we proposed in our original design. 
All the candidate cities are depicted on the map and their location information is readily available at a glance. It is also easy to tell which cities are the popular candidate cities (the city hosted multiple times) as the size of the city token is proportional to the times they participated in the bid. We also provides a wealth of aggregate information via interactive visualization techniques. 
<br/>
In summary our project provides an excellent opportunity for people to gain insights into the complete history of the bids of Olympic Games, an integral yet often overlooked component of the largest multi-sports events.
